Website performance isn't just a nice-to-have, it's a necessity. This guide, drawing inspiration from deco.cx's approach to performance, will explain why.</p>\n\n<h2>User Experience (UX): Don't Keep Visitors Waiting</h2>\n\n<p>People expect websites to load quickly. Studies show that even a one-second delay can lead to decreased satisfaction and higher bounce rates (people leaving your site). Deco.cx focuses on technologies like server-side rendering (SSR) and edge deployment to minimize load times and keep users engaged.</p>\n\n<h2>Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Speed as a Ranking Factor</h2>\n\n<p>Google and other search engines consider site speed when ranking websites.  A faster website can lead to better visibility in search results. Deco.cx's optimizations aim to give your content the best chance to shine in search engines.</p>\n\n<h2>Conversions: Turning Browsers into Customers</h2>\n\n<p>Slow websites hurt conversions. If your site takes too long to load, people are less likely to stick around to complete a purchase, fill out a form, or subscribe to your newsletter. Deco.cx understands this, and its architecture helps you create a seamless experience that encourages action.</p>\n\n<h2>Beyond the Basics: Deco.cx Performance Concepts</h2>\n\n<p>Here's a quick breakdown of terms important to deco.cx's performance philosophy:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>SSR (Server-Side Rendering):</strong>  Pre-renders pages on the server for fast initial loads.</li>\n  <li><strong>Edge Deployment:</strong>  Distributes your site globally, so users get content from servers closer to them.</li>\n  <li><strong>Static Assets:</strong> Optimizing images, scripts, etc., for smaller file sizes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Embrace Speed as a Core Value</h2>\n\n<p>Website performance might seem technical, but its effects are clear. By prioritizing speed, like Deco.cx does, you enhance user experience, boost SEO, and drive better results for your business or project.</p>\n","date":"2024-04-10","image":"https://ozksgdmyrqcxcwhnbepg.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/4763/682eb374-def2-4e85-a45d-b3a7ff8a31a9"}}
